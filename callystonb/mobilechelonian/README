Turtle.js is the backend and contains the paper.js library. 
Anywidget doesn't seem to be able to handle imports so I had to add the whole library
The turtledrawing function is what is responsible for creating the visuals that students see.


The Callysto Hub doesn't have "Anywidget" installed so you will need to pip install it.


Currently here are the areas that still need to be worked on:
- The turtle doesn't move. This might be due to there not being any update function in "turtle.js" (that I'm aware of). 
- Currently when you try and read the points the turtle has to go to model.get("points") works but you cannot assign it to anything.
- Move the Turtle class to its own init file so it's not in the frontend where user's can see it
- Test to make sure that all functions works like previously
