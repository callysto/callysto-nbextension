Below are the steps required to run these extensions on an jupyter notebook instance:

1.  Install jupyter_contrib_nbextension & jupyter_nbextensions_configurator.
        - Once installed, make sure that you see a new tab available on jupyter notebook called "NBextensions".

2. Navigate to where you have installed Jupyter and find the "NBextensions" directory.

3. Copy and paste the Extensions found in this project into that folder.

4. Run Jupyter notebook and make sure that the extensions are enabled (click on the "NBextensions" tab and make sure the extension is checked).

5. Create a new notebook and the extension should be working.
